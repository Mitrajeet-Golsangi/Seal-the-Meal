# Seal-the-Meal

A Diet Application for the better nutrition of everyone

# About the Project

This project was initially intended as a Software Development Lifecycle case study. The project was intended to be a platform to test out the agile methodology and to give budding software developers familiarity regarding the same.
For further in-depth discussion regarding the same please refer to the [research paper](https://www.proquest.com/openview/26ccb451e43dfd6529394586a38de71b/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=2040552) published on the same topic.

After some time on the project though the development team decided to take the project further and make it a fully functional application. The backend was developed with a amalgamation of Firebase and [Golang API](https://www.github.com/Mitrajeet-Golsangi/diet-application-backend) with a [Python backend](https://www.github.com/Mitrajeet-Golsangi/diet-application-recommendation-model) specifically for the recommendation system and the frontend is developed using Flutter.
